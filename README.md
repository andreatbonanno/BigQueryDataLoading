# BigQueryDataLoading

### Load data from text files (.csv,.tsv, etc.) stored in Google cloud storage to BigQuery with the Google BigQuery Python API. Tables are created on load using custom table schemas defined in CSV.

As an example, the script uses a definition of the BigQuery Export schema in csv format. All the other table schemas act as placeholders.
